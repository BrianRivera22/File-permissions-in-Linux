<h1> File permissions in Linux </h1>
<h2> Project description </h2>
<p>As a security analyst I can demonstrate that I can set appropriate access permissions to protect sensitive information and maintain the overall security of a system. I used Linux commands to configure authorization. Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. It's important because without authorization any user could access and modify all files belonging to other users or system files. This would certainly be a security risk.</p>
<p>In this scenario, I examined and managed the permissions on the files in the /home/researcher2/projects directory for the researcher2 user. The researcher2 is the user and the research_team is the group. I checked the permissions for all files in the directory, including the hidden files, to make sure that the permissions aligned with the authorization that should be given.</p> 
<p>Hereâ€™s how I did this task: First, I checked the user and group permissions for all files in the projects directory. Then, I checked whether any files had incorrect permissions and changed the permissions as needed. Finally, I checked the permissions of the /home/researcher2/projects/drafts directory and modified those permissions to remove any unauthorized access.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Here I showed that I have practical experience in using basic Linux Bash shell commands to:</p>
<li>examine file and directory permissions</li>
<li>change permissions on files</li>
<li>change permissions on directories </li>
